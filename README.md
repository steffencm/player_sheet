# PlayerSheet
This project is a learning experience on how to create Angular 2 application. I've been listening to a lot
of The Adventure Zone and I thought it would be fun to create  a Dungeons and Dragons playersheet. This repo
is for UI written in Angular 2 and using the Material Design styling. I have since found Angular-Material
but I have not brought it into this. Eventually I plan on adding a Go Rest service to support it.
